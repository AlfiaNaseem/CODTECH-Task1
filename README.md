The objective of this project is to consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Indore region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

KEY ACTIVITES

To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
To create a linear model that relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Dataset: A collection of housing related sets of information.
Python: High level programming language, Jupyter Notebook IDLE is used in this task.
Matplotlib: Plotting Library for the python programming language.
